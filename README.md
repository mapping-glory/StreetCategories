# StreetCategories
ArcGIS tool to categorize streets by name family.

Requires ArcGIS and ArcPy. Other dependencies to be added.

This tool, intended as a add-on Toolbox script in ArcGIS Desktop, adds a field called "NameFam" to a street layer and categorizes it based on name. In the US, presidents, states, numbers, trees, and flowers are all popular sources of street names.
